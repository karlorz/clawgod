# Installer build sources

`install.sh` and `install.ps1` are generated, committed release artifacts.
Edit the files under this directory, then rebuild from the repository root:

```bash
node build.js
node build.js --check
```

The build must remain byte-for-byte reproducible. CI runs `--check` and fails
when either generated installer is missing or differs from its sources.
`.gitattributes` pins the complete build graph to LF on every platform.

## Testing

`src/shared/patch.test.mjs` tests the classifier-timeout helper in
`runtime-helpers.cjs` and runs the patcher on Ultraplan fixtures for legacy
bundles and chunk graphs. It checks runtime toggles, metadata preservation,
and rejection of unsupported shapes without changing neighboring commands.
No Claude bundle is needed. Run locally with Node:

```bash
node src/shared/patch.test.mjs
```

`src/shared/bun-ant-shim.test.mjs` tests the `Bun.ant.CellSegmenter`
implementation in `bun-ant-shim.cjs`: escape scanning, grapheme widths, style
runs, hyperlink runs, capacity reporting, and the cell/damage packing that the
patched bundle reads back. It runs under plain Node as well, because the shim
falls back to a local width table when `Bun.stringWidth` is unavailable:

```bash
node src/shared/bun-ant-shim.test.mjs
```

`src/shared/terminal-reply.test.mjs` checks the incomplete DA1 reply timer,
normal keyboard/paste fallback, its two-second timeout, and the actual patch
composition for legacy bundles and chunk graphs:

```bash
node src/shared/terminal-reply.test.mjs
```

While a terminal probe is pending, a lone Escape or Alt+[ may wait up to two
seconds for a reply continuation before the original parser handles it. With
no outstanding probe, the original input timing is unchanged.

`src/shared/lean.test.mjs` exercises the full launcher with isolated settings,
plus the Unix and Windows installer settings scripts. It covers on/max/off
transitions, old Remote Control settings migration, PowerShell Boolean casing,
provider parity, and preservation of explicit network environment settings:

```bash
node src/shared/lean.test.mjs
```

`src/shared/provider.test.mjs` runs the launcher and proxy request handler with
isolated configuration and mocked HTTP transport. It checks provider authentication,
blank-token fallback, effort translation and environment precedence, including
streaming requests and custom model aliases that omit `output_config`:

```bash
node src/shared/provider.test.mjs
```

`src/shared/openai-proxy.test.mjs` exercises request/response translation,
including inline system messages alongside the top-level system prompt,
tool selection and parallel calls, images/PDFs and unsupported content errors,
local token estimates, HTTP failures, SSE framing and fragmented UTF-8,
usage trailers, incomplete streams, cancellation, and timeouts. The provider
suite also checks protocol selection, legacy aliases, and configuration errors.

```bash
node --test src/shared/openai-proxy.test.mjs
bun test src/shared/openai-proxy.test.mjs src/shared/openai-proxy.integration.test.mjs
```

The integration suite runs a real Bun proxy and loopback HTTP upstream. It
verifies a complete tool call/result round trip, streaming token accounting,
error status/retry headers, local counting without network calls, and stream
timeouts. It is skipped under Node, which cannot run `Bun.serve`. CI runs the
protocol suite under Node and both suites under Bun on Unix and Windows.
These fixtures do not certify compatibility with every third-party model.

CI runs the JavaScript suites in the `build-sources` job, then loads the shim under Bun in the
smoke jobs (`compat-daily.yml`).

`src/ci/tui-smoke.py` tests an installed CLI in a POSIX PTY or Windows ConPTY.
It uses isolated configuration and a local mock API, types a prompt, and
checks the rendered screen for the reply. Install its Python dependencies
from `src/ci/tui-requirements.txt`. Windows CI runs it against both the latest
Claude/Bun canary and Claude 2.1.272/Bun 1.4.2; the pinned case must also
reproduce the missing CellSegmenter error with the shim disabled. Terminal
logs, final screens and results are uploaded as CI artifacts.

`src/ci/test_tui_smoke.py` covers Windows ConPTY teardown, including delayed
process exit after `taskkill`, already-exited processes, bounded cleanup, and
propagation of real cleanup failures. It runs on any platform with the same
Python dependencies; Windows CI runs it before the interactive smoke tests.
On Windows it also repeatedly closes real ConPTY sessions and checks that an
already-exited session releases its sockets; those cases skip elsewhere.

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/ci -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Teardown waits up to five seconds for the underlying PTY process to exit before
calling pywinpty's `close`. It polls `process.pty.isalive()` rather than the
wrapper's `process.isalive()`, which marks the wrapper closed on exit and would
skip closing its sockets. A live process after the deadline still fails CI;
the sockets are released even if cleanup fails.

`src/shared/updater.test.mjs` checks that every Lean mode disables native
background updates before loading Claude, including inherited false values.
`src/shared/startup-check.test.mjs` checks the installer's bounded startup
probe, version output, errors, closed stdin, paths with spaces/non-ASCII text,
process-tree timeout cleanup, logs, and standalone version-query side effects.
Version detection uses stdout independently of stderr and the truncated log
tail, including split writes and interleaved/noisy diagnostics.
It also runs the real Bun launcher when Bun is on PATH or specified through
`CLAWGOD_TEST_BUN`. `src/windows/startup-check.test.ps1` exercises the actual
PowerShell installer check with successful, failing and hanging child processes.
The smoke jobs preconfigure a dummy Chat provider before the real installation,
retain it through repeated `--no-upgrade` runs and launcher version queries,
and reject any probe that starts a proxy listener. Windows also pins Claude
2.1.285, the version reported in #203, alongside the existing compatibility cases.

Both installers use `startup-check.cjs` (under Node) to run Bun's
`cli.cjs --version` with a 30-second deadline. `CLAWGOD_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS`
can raise that deadline on slow machines. Failures preserve the output in
`~/.clawgod/startup-check.log` and abort before replacing launchers; printing a
version without exiting is still a failure. A standalone `--version` or `-v`
loads the patched bundle and runtime helpers without initializing the provider,
migrating settings, or starting the background release check.

`src/windows/launchers.test.ps1` runs the installer's launcher section on real
Windows files, including repeated installs, restored official executables,
running binaries, deletion/rename locks, recovery, and original backups.
Run them with Node and Windows PowerShell 5.1 respectively; CI runs both.

## Layout

`source-backup.json` in the installed directory stores the complete clean
JavaScript source (entry and graph chunks) after extraction/post-processing.
The patcher reads it before applying patches, and writes runtime source only
if no patch failed. Fresh installs replace the snapshot; `--no-upgrade` reuses
it. Older installations without a complete snapshot fetch the exact installed
version once to recover clean source. `--capture-clean-source` is an installer
operation and must only run against freshly extracted, unpatched source.

`node src/shared/source-backup.test.mjs` covers repeated patching, graph and
legacy backups, version/file-set validation, revert, and failure without source
writes, plus Unix migration and failure propagation. The Windows preflight is
covered by `src/windows/source-recovery.test.ps1`. CI also repeats the actual
Unix and Windows installers and compares their patch summaries with the first
install.

- `shared/` contains payloads embedded identically in both installers,
  including `cli.cjs` (the launcher/patcher bootstrap shared by Unix and
  Windows). `feature-gates.cjs` carries a `{{CLAWGOD:FEATURES_META}}` marker
  that build.js replaces with the inverted FEATURES registry from patch.mjs.
  `bun-ant-shim.cjs` re-implements the `Bun.ant.CellSegmenter` API that Claude
  Code 2.1.271+ renders through, since stock Bun has no `Bun.ant` namespace;
  `cli.cjs` loads it before `cli.original.cjs`.
- `windows/` contains genuinely platform-specific payloads (the PowerShell
  build applies `escapeNonAscii` per file in build.js).
- `templates/` contain the shell around those payloads and use
  `{{CLAWGOD:<installed-name>}}` placeholders.

The PowerShell template and generated installer are intentionally BOM-free and
ASCII-only. This keeps both direct Windows PowerShell 5.1 execution and the
documented `irm ... | iex` path independent of the machine's active code page.
`build.js` escapes Unicode in embedded JavaScript/JSON payloads as `\uXXXX`.

Do not edit the generated installers directly. If an emergency fix starts in a
generated file, port it to the corresponding source/template immediately and
run the build before committing.
